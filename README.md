## Business Scenario

NHS organisations publish thousands of job vacancies containing valuable information about skills, career progression and recruitment trends. However, this information is spread across individual job adverts, making large-scale analysis difficult.

The NHS Career Intelligence Platform provides a modern cloud-based data platform that ingests, transforms and enriches NHS recruitment data. The platform enables workforce analytics today while laying the foundations for AI-powered career guidance through semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
